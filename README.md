# Hierarchical Sub-step Flowchart Format

The Hierarchical Sub-step Flowchart format is a visual representation style that emphasizes a hierarchical structure with the ability to represent sub-steps, in this example, up to five levels deep. It provides a clear and organized way to depict the logical routines of a program or process.

## Flowchart Template

Use the following template to create your flowchart:

```
┌─ Start Program
│
├─ [Step 1]
│   ├─ [Step 1.1]
│   │   ├─ [Step 1.1.1]
│   │   │   ├─ [Step 1.1.1.1]
│   │   │   │   └─ [Action]
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   ├─ [Step 1.1.1.2]
│   │   │   └─ [Step 1.1.1.3]
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ [Step 1.1.2]
│   │   └─ [Step 1.1.3]
│   │
│   ├─ [Step 1.2]
│   │   ├─ [Step 1.2.1]
│   │   ├─ [Step 1.2.2]
│   │   │   ├─ [Step 1.2.2.1]
│   │   │   └─ [Step 1.2.2.2]
│   │   │       └─ [Action]
│   │   │
│   │   └─ [Step 1.2.3]
│   │
│   └─ [Step 1.3]
│
├─ [Step 2]
│   ├─ [Step 2.1]
│   │   ├─ [Step 2.1.1]
│   │   └─ [Step 2.1.2]
│   │       ├─ [Step 2.1.2.1]
│   │       └─ [Step 2.1.2.2]
│   │
│   └─ [Step 2.2]
│       └─ [Step 2.2.1]
│
└─ End Program
```
Replace `[Step X]` with the actual steps, and `[Action]` with the corresponding actions or tasks.

## Tutorial: Converting Logic Path to Hierarchical Sub-step Flowchart

Follow these steps to convert your logic path to the Hierarchical Sub-step Flowchart format:

1. Identify your logical path: Understand the sequence of steps and decisions in your program or process.
2. Determine main steps: Identify the primary steps or actions in your logical path.
3. Break down steps into sub-steps: Identify smaller, more specific tasks or decisions within each main step.
4. Apply hierarchical numbering: Use a hierarchical numbering system to denote levels of steps and sub-steps.
5. Populate the flowchart template: Replace placeholders with identified steps and sub-steps, ensuring the numbering scheme aligns with the hierarchy.
6. Define actions for each step: Describe the specific actions or tasks for each step and sub-step.
7. Customize and expand: Adjust the flowchart to suit your program's requirements, adding additional steps or actions as needed.
8. Review and iterate: Ensure accuracy and clarity of the flowchart, making necessary revisions for a comprehensive representation of the logic path.

## Decoration and Visual Appeal

To enhance the clarity and aesthetics of the flowchart, you can use Unicode characters.

#### Here are some commonly used ones:
- Box Drawing Characters: ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼
- Line Characters: ─ │ ━ ┃
- Arrow Characters: ← → ↑ ↓ ↔ ↕ ↖ ↗ ↙ ↘
- Geometric Shapes: □ ○ ● ◇ ◆ ■
- Brackets and Parentheses: [ ] { } ( ) < >

Integrate these characters in your flowchart to visually represent different elements and improve readability.

## Usage

With the Hierarchical Sub-step Flowchart format, you can create visually appealing and comprehensive representations of your program's logical routines. By following the tutorial and utilizing Unicode characters, you can effectively communicate complex logic paths in an organized and easily understandable manner.
